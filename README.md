# simon-says-Game
This project is a simple implementation of the classic Simon game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game challenges players to repeat sequences of colors in the correct order, with the sequences becoming progressively longer and more difficult.

# How to Play
1. Start the Game:

. Press any key to start the game.

2. Watch the Sequence:

. The game will flash a sequence of buttons. Watch carefully and remember the order.

3. Repeat the Sequence:

. Click the buttons in the same order as the sequence shown.

4. Level Up:

. If you correctly repeat the sequence, you will progress to the next level, and the sequence will get longer.

5. Game Over:

. If you make a mistake, the game will display "Game Over" and show your score. The highest score will be tracked and displayed on the screen.

6. Restart the Game:

. Press any key to start again after a game over.

# Features
. Random Sequence Generation: Each level generates a new color sequence to follow.
. User Input Handling: Click on buttons to repeat the sequence.
. Level Tracking: The game displays the current level.
. Highest Score Tracking: The game displays and updates the highest score achieved.

# Future Improvements
. Add sounds to each button press for a more immersive experience.
. Improve the UI design to make the game more visually appealing.
. Add more levels of difficulty or different game modes.
